								<h3>Experiences</h3>
								<p>
									For field experience I have had two school projects that worked with a real client and 
									a problem they wanted to solve and two internships.
								</p>
								<h4>Azerion</h4>
								<p>
									One of these was for Orange Games, which was part of Azerion. 
									Here in a group of 3 students we made a prototype which included Augmented Reality for them and 
									wrote a report on how they could use and implement this technology for future projects. 
									This report also included how Augmented Reality works and what they need to watch out for when designing AR applications.
								</p>
								<h4>Juristic Application</h4>
								<p>
									The second project was with a group of 6 where we were asked to look at the company's current CI/CD pipeline and 
									give them advice on how they could increase their security by adding a DAST to increase security.
								</p>
								<h4>Azerion</h4>
								<p>
									The first internship was also for Orange Games, where I was part of the development team for Governor of Poker 3. 
									For this internship I was researching if they could improve a certain part of their back-end functionality.
								</p>
								<h4>TransEET</h4>
								<p>
									The second internship is for TransEET where the goal is to create a prototype of an Educational Augmented Reality Game for students to help learn Geometry. 
									To focus is on formulas of areas of surfaces on 3D objects like cubes, cylinders, cones and prisms. I was the only developer working on this prototype but had a team of researchers to get feedback from.
									One researcher has experience with programming, while two others are also educating students to become mathematics teachers.
