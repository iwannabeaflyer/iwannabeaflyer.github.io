										This was the first game made I made with a team of 4-5 other students which was during the first semester of my education. One of the students wanted to drop out of the study
										and mostly worked on graphics as that was what he wanted to focus more on rather than the programming part.
										The game was made in<a href="https://processing.org/"> Processing 2</a>
										The aim of the game is to make it as high as possible without getting hit by the
										traps or get caught up by the ever rising lava.
										My main task was to create the behaviour and animation of the traps.
										There was a Game Design Document and user test scenario's written.
										Towards the end of the project there was an playtest session for the beta of our game, to get feedback to make improvements for the final version.
										The project also use Git for source control and Trello for the user scenarios and the correspondending tasks.
										Below is a short video of the game with gameplay.

										The application was written in JAVA and was made for KLM's employees that can be used on the workfloor to improve their workflow.
										My tasks was a small bit of functionality of the back-end of the application but mostly front-end and user experience as well as make an user guide.
										Part of the user experience was different themes for the application and the possibility of changing the language of the application.

										This project is made for the course Game Mechanics where the goal of the course is to document everything about the game you are about to design
										and use this to improve the game as well as make it more clear to others what you envision your game to be.
										The things that needed to be worked out include: Concept, Core Mechanic Diagram, Skill Chain, Machinations, Boss States and Play Tests.

									<h3>Game Concept</h3>
									<h5>My Concept</h5>
									<p>
										The objective of the game is that you push or pull the magnets within the walls
										and make your way towards the exit. You move a magnet with keys to your liking
										and you will be able to switch between positve or negative charged.
										Depending on the current charge the magnet moves in a specific direction.

									<h3>Playtests</h3>
									<p>
										From the first playtest it was clear that the your charge bar what indicates how
										much charge you have left was
										not clear enough and overlooked in the beginning. Further was it not clear if
										you picked up a key or not.
										Lastly the area that gives you charge back looked just like enemy or magnet so
										the player thought he had to do something
										with it. But in fact you need to stand against it to get some charge.

										The theme of the game was Watch Your Step. Your goal is to escape the prison by
										finding the stairs and avoiding the camera's and guards. The catch is that, you are wounded
										and with each step, you lose some blood. To make it out alive, you have to find the bloodbags scattered
										around to make sure you don't bleed out.

									<h2>Mobile Development</h2>
									<hr class="star-primary">
									<p>
										This minor is focused all around making mobile application and designing for
										mobile.
										The classes that I had during this minor are:
										<br>
										- Mobile Programming
										<br>
										- Mobile Society
										<br>
										- Mobile Infrastructure and Security
										<br>
										- Mobile Design
										<br><br />
										Mobile Programming is a course that teaches the basics of Android Studio to create basic apps like a shopping basket.
										Mobile Society went more in depth in how mobile devices are integrated into society and how to design applications with this in mind. 
										Mobile Infrastructure and Security goes deeper into how to setup the infrastructure for mobile applications as well as to make an mobile applications more secure.
										Lastly Mobile Design was purely about creating good User Interfaces fit for mobile devices. There was a focus on paper prototyping the design to more easily change aspects
										of the program and only once the paper prototype was good, make a functional application in Android Studio.
										<br><br />
										Furthermore there was a group project where you were working with a real
										company.
										In this project I worked together with two Software Engineers to make a
										mobile AR (Augmented Reality) application using Unity. This was made for 
										OrangeGames, which was part of <a href="https://www.azerion.com/">Azerion</a>.
										I can't go into more detail as I have signed a NDA for this project.

										This was my first minor. In this minor the main focus was more on the
										programming side of making games and less on designing it.
										The subjects I had during this minor where:
										<br>
										- Design Patterns
										<br>
										- Advanced Physics
										<br>
										- Graphics Programming
										<br>
										- Research Design GT
										<br><br />
										The subject Design Patterns was all about as the name implies Design Patterns for programming.
										Advanced Physics was more about time and space complexity of data structures, how to calculate and optimize your program to improve these. As well as learning how to do 
										Matrix calculations.
										For Graphics Programming, the goal was to learn more about how games are rendered and how to optimize this. Part of this was to create custom meshes through vertexes, edges and vertices
										and move these to create illusions of animation.
										For Research Design the main focus is on how to better conduct research and if you have certain information, how to get possible information from an underlying problem.
										<br><br />
										I also worked on a project with 6 other students. This project was making a game
										with C++ with an engine of choice.
										We chose for the <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/"> Irrlicht </a>
										engine.
										<br><br />
										The game we worked on was race game with Tron like bike's. We decided to give a
										twist to the racing aspect by making the track less visible the faster you
										drove. Also, over time the visibilty became worse over time to enfore the player to go for pick-ups to increase their visibilty again.
										There were more types of power-ups like a speed boost.
										Further did we decide on having both the player and the AI have a trail that
										will always glow but of a certain length. This is to make it a bit easier on the
										player and he/she is able to see how the track curves based on the trail of your opponents.

										This is my 2nd minor and this minor is at the VU (University). This minor is
										also focused on programming. Sadly some parts where slightly to high or we went
										over to fast for me to pass. I did write in JAVA, Python, Haskell and C during this minor.
										<br>
										The subjects i had during this minor where:
										<br>
										- Systems Programming
										<br>
										- Concurrency and Multithreading
										<br>
										- Compiler Construction
										<br>
										- Equational Programming
										<br>
										- Secure Programming
										<br>
										Concurrency and Multithreading was written in Java, but this required a specific way of thinking which I struggled with.
										Compiler Construction is making parts of a Compiler and testing it so which was written in C, this I did pass.
										Equational Programming was done using Haskell and was the easiest subject of them since it is heavenly focused on Recursion.
										Systems Programming and Secure Programming where in Python and was more about writing programs and making them more secure.

										These subjects are the four different stages at which one can find themselfs when it comes to security and each focusses on what you can do to increase the security

										<p>Besides these subjects, there was also a project in which you had contact with

										For the project I was in, we were asked to find a Dynamic Application Security

									<hr class="star-primary">
									<p> For my graduation, I worked for the Smart Education Lab of the AUAS. The project that I worked on is a project for <a href="https://transeet.eu/">TransEET</a>. 
										My work consisted of making an prototype for an Educational Game that makes use of Augmented Reality.
										This prototype is meant to learn the basics of geometric formulas of surfaces of 3D geometrical objects. The objective is to make 3D geometrical figures dissapear by using 
										the correct formula per surface. Wether the player used the incorrect or correct formula, the color of the surfaces will change as feedback as well as each surface will tell 
										the player, what formula they used on that surface. If a surface was correct, it will dissapear after a few seconds to give view of more surfaces. 
										From several iterations, much feedback has been collected which can be used to improve the prototype in the future.
										A video demo can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLQ5p3K1O4&ab_channel=incognito">here</a>.
										This prototype was also presented at two differnt symposiums.
										The first symposium was the Second International Symposium on Augmented and Virtual Reality in Mathematics Education.
										The second symposium was the <a href="https://www.hva.nl/appliedai/gedeelde-content/evenementen/evenementen/2024/06/symposium-smart-education.html">Symposium Smart Education</a>.

										I have worked on several projects on my own. Some of these can been seen on Github but usually 
										I'm more interested in a certain feature and try to make something with that but I never really develop that into
										a bigger project. So most of these projects tends to be small. 
										<br> 
										I do have a bigger project that I worked on for a while.
										This project came to be alive when Covid struck since it became alot more difficult
										to get an internship and got a lot more spare time. At the time I wanted a way to save data on shows and movies in JSON format
										and where the application was offline. This was so that I wouldn't have to worry about servers and I could still access all the data
										I needed about the shows I had watched or was planning on watching. It started as a purely console application but once it was finished it
										did include multi-language support and functionality to acces certain websites with the name of the show to get more information online. 
										After this I decided to format it to a Windows Forms Application of which took more time than anticipated. 
										<br>
										Currently I'm developing a simple AR Game about merging objects.
