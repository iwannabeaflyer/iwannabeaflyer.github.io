									<h2>Game Technology</h2>

										This was my first minor. In this minor the main focus was more on the

										- Design Patterns
										<br>
										- Advanced Physics
										<br>
										- Graphics Programming
										<br>
										- Research Design GT
										<br><br />
										I also worked on a project with 6 other students. This project was making a game
										with C++ with an engine of choice.
										We chose for the <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/"> Irrlicht </a>
										engine.
										<br><br />
										The game we worked on was race game with Tron like bike's. We decided to give a
										twist to the racing aspect by making the track less visible the faster you
										drove.

										- Fear, Uncertaincy and Doubt
										<br>
										- Know Your Position
										<br>
										- Get In Control
										<br>
										- When Murphy Strikes
										<br>
										These subjects are the four different stages at which one can find themselfs when it comes to security and each focusses on what you can do to increase the security
										of anything, not just programs. For all of them I had to write an report corresponding to their respective stage of security.
									
										<p>
										Besides these subjects, there was also a project in which you had contact with
										someone that had a real problem.
										For the project I was involved in, we were asked to find a Dynamic Application Security
										Testing (DAST) tool that fits
										on the customers current Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery(CI/CD)
										pipeline. For this project I have signed an NDA, which doesn't allow me to give more information.

									<h2>Graduation Internship</h2>
									<p> For my graduation, I worked for the Smart Education Lab of the AUAS. The project that I worked on is a project for <a href="https://transeet.eu/">TransEET</a>. 
										My work consisted of making an prototype for an Educational Game that makes use of Augmented Reality. The prototype was made in Unity using AR Foundation (Unity's AR API).
										This prototype is meant to learn the basics of geometric formulas of surfaces of 3D geometrical objects. The objective is to make 3D geometrical figures dissapear by using 
										the correct formula per surface.
										This prototype was also presented at two differnt symposiums.
										The first symposium was the Second International Symposium on Augmented and Virtual Reality in Mathematics Education.
										The second symposium was the <a href="https://www.hva.nl/appliedai/gedeelde-content/evenementen/evenementen/2024/06/symposium-smart-education.html">Symposium Smart Education</a>.
										At both symposium there was interest shown in the prototype.

									<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
									<p>
										I have worked on several projects on my own. Some of these can been seen on Github but usually 
										I'm more interested in a certain feature and try to make something with that but I never really develop that into
										a bigger project. So most of these projects tends to be small. 
										<br> 
										I do have a bigger project that I worked on for a while.
										This project came to be alive when Covid struck since it became alot more difficult
										to get an internship and got a lot more spare time. At the time I wanted a way to save data on shows and movies in JSON format
										and where the application was offline. This was so that I wouldn't have to worry about servers and I could still access all the data
										I needed about the shows I had watched or was planning on watching. It started as a purely console application but once it was finished it
										did include multi-language support and functionality to acces certain websites with the name of the show to get more information online. 
										After this I decided to format it to a Windows Forms Application of which took more time than anticipated.
