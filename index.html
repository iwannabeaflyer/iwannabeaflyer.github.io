										The objective of the game is that you push or pull the magnets within the walls
										and make your way towards the exit. You move a magnet with keys to your liking
										and you will be able to switch between positve or negative charged.
										Depending on the current charge the magnet moves in a specific direction.

										From the first playtest it was clear that the your charge bar what indicates how
										much charge you have left was
										not clear enough and overlooked in the beginning. Further was it not clear if
										you picked up a key or not.
										Lastly the area that gives you charge back looked just like enemy or magnet so
										the player thought he had to do something
										with it. But in fact you need to stand against it to get some charge.

									<p> This game was made during our project named Project Game Development. We made
										this game with a total of 4 developers and
										it was made within a half year in Unity.
										The theme of the game was Watch Your Step. Your goal is to escape the prison by
										finding the stairs and avoiding the camera's and guards. The catch is that, you are wounded
										and with each step, you lose some blood. To make it out alive, you have to find the bloodbags scattered
										around to make sure you don't bleed out.

									<p>
										This was my first minor. In this minor the main focus was more on the
										programming side of making games and less on designing it.
										The subjects I had during this minor where:
										<br>
										- Design Patterns
										<br>
										- Advanced Physics
										<br>
										- Graphics Programming
										<br>
										- Research Design GT
										<br><br />
										I also worked on a project with 6 other students. This project was making a game
										with C++ with an engine of choice.
										We chose for the <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/"> Irrlicht </a>
										engine.
										<br><br />
										The game we worked on was race game with Tron like bike's. We decided to give a
										twist to the racing aspect by making the track less visible the faster you
										drove. Also, over time the visibilty became worse over time to enfore the player to go for pick-ups to increase their visibilty again.
										There were more types of power-ups like a speed boost.
										Further did we decide on having both the player and the AI have a trail that
										will always glow but of a certain length. This is to make it a bit easier on the
										player and he/she is able to see how the track curves based on the trail of your opponents.

									<h2>Deep Programming</h2>
									<hr class="star-primary">
									<p>
										This is my 2nd minor and this minor is at the VU (University). This minor is
										also focused on programming. Sadly some parts where slightly to high or we went
										over to fast for me to pass.
										<br>
										The subjects i had during this minor where:
										<br>
										- Systems Programming
										<br>
										- Concurrency and Multithreading
										<br>
										- Compiler Construction
										<br>
										- Equational Programming
										<br>
										- Secure Programming
										<br>
										Concurrency and Multithreading was written in Java, but this required a specific way of thinking which I struggled with.
										Compiler Construction is making parts of a Compiler and testing it so which was written in C, this I did pass.
										Equational Programming was done using Haskell and was the easiest subject of them since it is heavenly focused on Recursion.
										Systems Programming and Secure Programming where in Python and was more about writing programs and making them more secure.

										This is my 2nd minor I followed this to get the last few required points needed

										<br>
										- Fear, Uncertaincy and Doubt
										<br>
										- Know Your Position
										<br>
										- Get In Control
										<br>
										- When Murphy Strikes
										<br>
										These subjects are the four different stages at which one can find themselfs when it comes to security and each focusses on what you can do to increase the security
										of anything, not just programs.
									
										<p>Besides these subjects, there was also a project in which you had contact with
										someone that had a real problem.
										For the project I was in, we were asked to find a Dynamic Application Security
										Testing (DAST) tool that fits
										on the customers current Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery(CI/CD)
										pipeline. For this project I have signed an NDA, which doesn't allow me to give more information.

									<hr class="star-primary">
									<p> For my graduation, I worked for the Smart Education Lab of the AUAS. The project that I worked on is a project for <a href="https://transeet.eu/">TransEET</a>. 
										My work consisted of making an prototype for an Educational Game that makes use of Augmented Reality.
										This prototype is meant to learn the basics of geometric formulas of surfaces of 3D geometrical objects. The objective is to make 3D geometrical figures dissapear by using 
										the correct formula per surface. Wether the player used the incorrect or correct formula, the color of the surfaces will change as feedback as well as each surface will tell 
										the player, what formula they used on that surface. If a surface was correct, it will dissapear after a few seconds to give view of more surfaces. 
										From several iterations, much feedback has been collected which can be used to improve the prototype in the future.
										A video demo can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLQ5p3K1O4&ab_channel=incognito">here</a>.
										This prototype was also presented at two differnt symposiums.
										The first symposium was the Second International Symposium on Augmented and Virtual Reality in Mathematics Education.
										The second symposium was the <a href="https://www.hva.nl/appliedai/gedeelde-content/evenementen/evenementen/2024/06/symposium-smart-education.html">Symposium Smart Education</a>.
										At both symposium there was interest in the prototype.

										I have worked on several projects on my own. Some of these can been seen on Github but usually

										I do have a bigger project that I worked on for a while.
										This project came to be alive when Covid struck since it became alot more difficult
										to get an internship and got a lot more spare time. At the time I wanted a way to save data on shows and movies in JSON format
										and where the application was offline. This was so that I wouldn't have to worry about servers and I could still access all the data
										I needed about the shows I had watched or was planning on watching. It started as a purely console application but once it was finished it
										did include multi-language support and functionality to acces certain websites with the name of the show to get more information online. 
										After this I decided to format it to a Windows Forms Application of which took more time than anticipated. 
										<br>
										Currently I'm developing a simple AR Game about merging objects.
